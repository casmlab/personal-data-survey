# personal-data-survey

Analyzes data from surveys re: personal data

We surveyed two populations:
1. Qualtrics panel with minimum quotas for Black folks and non-users of social media (N = 586)
2. Mechanical Turkers (N = 389)

# Manual data prep

I did some of the data prep manually:

* removing columns that are for Qualtrics or MTurk but not data
* removing headers that are not reasonable variable names
* replacing spaces in variable names with underscores
* replace ‚Äô with apostrophe
* removing display order variables
* lower casing variable names
* removed preview responses

It was faster to do by hand in Excel than to do programmatically.

# Repo structure

* [notebooks](notebooks): contains Jupyter notebooks with code for prepping and analyzing data; the [prep_data_for_analysis notebook](notebooks/prep_survey_responses.ipynb) does most of the data type and recoding work. Individual analysis notebooks focus on a particular research question and often start with some serious `mutation` work to get data into the right format.
* [reports](reports): contains output like tables and figures

# Codebook

Here's the original mapping of variable name to question from Qualtrics. The prep notebook changes some of these variable names, relevels, and recodes dummies.
